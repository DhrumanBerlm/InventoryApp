# InventoryApp
An app I made in grade 9 for my digital design project. It stores your inventory and allows you to track it. Made in android studio using java.
I did not know how to serialize data properly, or make data structures for that matter.  
  
### What I learnt in the proccess:  
- How to use Android Studio with Java  
- How to use Java (Basics)  
- How to serialize data (read and write to files) in Java  
- How to not make data structures
